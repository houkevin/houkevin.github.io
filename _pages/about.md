I graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelors in Computer Science.
â€‹
I have done an internship at Nokia Deepfield working as a Software Engineer.  During the internship, I was able to implement many positive changes to the test infrastructure of the product.  For example, I was able to reduce the runtime of Docker calls by 97% and made the tests run mroe robustly in Jenkins by including randomness in the testing order.

I have full stack skills, with experience in creating dynamic websites as well as Android and GUI applications and SQL/DBMS experience.
